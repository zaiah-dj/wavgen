-------

Summary
-------
This tool generates WAV files of just about any arbitrary length.

The primary purpose of this tool is to generate legimate binary data for testing high throughput applications.
However, you can take it and modify and do what you wish as it's a good starting point for basic sound synthesis.


Requirements
------------
Nothing that shouldn't be included with your standard C libraries.


Usage
-----
No options, just compile and run `./wavgen <length-of-file-in-seconds>`
